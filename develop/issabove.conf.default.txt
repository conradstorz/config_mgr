postcontent = This message was created by an ISS-Above that is somewhere in the world.  Hopefully the user will update this information soon<br /><br />
	This is one of the first new versions of the ISS-Above which features extended information via an attached Monitor (HDMI or Composite TV).   
  It also streams live video from the ISS HD Earth Viewing Experiment.   
  And.. as well as all that this little device lights up whenever The International Space Station is overhead.  <br /><br />
	How cool is that?!
